# Gold Price Prediction Model with Random Forest

This repository contains code for a machine learning model that predicts gold prices using Random Forest.

## Overview

This project implements a Random Forest model to predict gold prices. Python programming language was used for implementation, and Google Colab served as the development environment. The model aims to predict future gold prices based on historical data.

## Requirements

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab (for running the code)
- Libraries: pandas, scikit-learn

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/WarunaDissanayake1234/Gold-Price-Prediction-Model.git
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install pandas scikit-learn
   ```

3. **Run the Code:**
   - Open the Jupyter Notebook or upload the provided notebook to Google Colab.
   - Follow the instructions within the notebook to preprocess the data, train the Random Forest model, and predict future gold prices.
